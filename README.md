## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT


### PROJECT : PHISHING WEBSITE DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING



### OBJECTIVE



### Primary Objective


To design, develop, and implement a machine learning-based web application capable of accurately distinguishing between legitimate and phishing websites in real-time, thereby enhancing user cybersecurity protection.


### Technical Objectives

   - **To develop a robust machine learning model** utilizing Random Forest classification algorithm trained on comprehensive URL feature datasets for phishing detection.

   - **To implement feature engineering techniques** that extract and process critical URL attributes including:

>Structural characteristics **(URL length, subdomain hierarchy)**

>Security indicators **(HTTPS protocol, domain registration patterns)**

>Suspicious elements **(special characters, IP address usage)**

>Behavioral markers **(redirection patterns, anomalous components)**

   - **To design an intuitive web interface** using Flask framework that provides:

>Real-time URL analysis capabilities

>User-friendly input and result visualization

>Responsive design for cross-platform accessibility

   - **To achieve optimal performance metrics** targeting:

>Minimum 85% classification accuracy

>High precision and recall rates for both phishing and legitimate classes

>Low false positive rate to ensure user confidence

   - **To create a scalable architecture** that allows for:
     
>Easy model retraining with updated datasets

>Future integration of additional features

>Potential API development for third-party applications


### Functional Objectives

   - **Real-time Detection Capability:** Provide instantaneous phishing assessment for any submitted URL.

   - **User Accessibility:** Ensure the application is web-based and requires no technical expertise for operation.

   - **Educational Value:** Offer clear feedback that helps users understand why a website is classified as phishing or legitimate.

   - **Reliability:** Maintain consistent performance across diverse URL types and evolving phishing techniques.


### Research Objectives

   - **To contribute to cybersecurity research** by demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in phishing detection.

   - **To analyze feature importance** in URL classification and identify the most significant indicators of phishing attempts.

   - **To establish a baseline framework** that can be extended with more advanced algorithms and larger datasets.


### Practical Objectives

   - **Deploy a functional prototype** that can be used by individuals and organizations for preliminary phishing checks.

   - **Provide an open-source solution** that can be further developed by the cybersecurity community.

   - **Demonstrate cost-effective phishing protection** that doesn't require extensive computational resources.
